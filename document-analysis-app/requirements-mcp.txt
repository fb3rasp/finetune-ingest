# Additional requirements for MCP Server functionality
# Install these if you need MCP server capabilities:
# pip install -r requirements-mcp.txt

# Try these alternative MCP packages (uncomment one that works):
# mcp
# model-context-protocol
# anthropic-mcp
# mcp-python-sdk

# Alternative: Install from GitHub if PyPI version not available
# git+https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk.git

# Note: MCP support is optional - the main application works without it
