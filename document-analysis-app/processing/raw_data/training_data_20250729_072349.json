Rationale\nControls within the NZISM with a “SHOULD” and “SHOULD NOT” requirement may be risk managed by agencies. As the individual control security\nrisk for non-compliance is not as high as those controls with a ‘MUST’ or ‘MUST NOT’ requirement, the Accreditation Authority can consider the\njustification for the acceptance of risks, consider any mitigations then acknowledge and accept any residual risks.\n1.1.64.R.03. Rationale\nDeviations from the procedures and controls in the NZISM may represent risks in themselves. It is important that governance and assurance is\nsupported by evidence, especially where deviations from the procedures and controls in the NZISM are accepted.

Rationale\nIn the context of this section, outsourcing is defined as contracting an outside entity to provide essential business functions and processes that\ncould be undertaken by the Agency itself.\nOutsourcing may present elevated levels of risk and additional risks. Outsourcing therefore, requires greater consideration, demonstrable\ngovernance, and higher levels of assurance before committing to such contracts.\n2.2.5.R.02. Rationale\nA distinction is drawn between important business functions and the purchase of services such as power, water, building maintenance, stationery\nand telecommunications. These services are not usually provided by the agency itself.\nPurchased services, as identified above, do NOT require accreditation or a third party review as defined in the NZISM. However, normal contract due\ndiligence should be exercised before committing to these supply contracts.\n2.2.5.R.03. Rationale",
